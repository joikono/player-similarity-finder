## Technical Implementation

**Semantic Search Engine:**
This application demonstrates advanced semantic search by converting NBA player statistics into high-dimensional vectors stored in Pinecone. The similarity engine enables contextual player comparisons based on performance patterns rather than simple statistical matching.

**Vector Database Strategy:**
Pinecone integration provides:
- Scalable high-dimensional vector storage
- Sub-millisecond similarity queries
- Configurable similarity algorithms
- Real-time vector updates for current season data

**TypeScript Architecture:**
Comprehensive type safety across:
- React component interfaces
- API response schemas  
- Database interaction layers
- Statistical calculation functions
